defining variables
defining variables that will be used in jquery
defining Objects (by convnention those with cap letter[0] are objects)

  function promptfornumber(message)
    define a variable num which is established by doing the block of code:
      launches a prompt where the input value is the "message", with a while function that determines that the input is an illegal number (isNAN - is Not-A-Number), return the number
    So that in the game when you need to enter the qty of units you want this will occur and take your number and check to see if its a real number or not
